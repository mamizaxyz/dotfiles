# Dotfiles
Mamiza's Personal Dotfiles

# Usage
These dotfiles are intended to go with the programs I use:

- [Dwm](https://github.com/mamizaxyz/dwm) (Window Manager)
- [DwmBlocks](https://github.com/mamizaxyz/dwmblocks) (Statusbar for Dwm)

## Install these dotfiles and all dependencies

There is an installation script included with the dotfiles (MARS) that should install the dotfiles on your system
and more. There is also a 'progs' folder here that includes lists of my most used programs. The script may be
broken right now. I would suggest you copy these files to where they belong manually.
